### Patchers
BackToMac was created with both supported and unsupported Macs in mind.After going through the instructions,the user can choose between two patchers from two different developers : dosdude1 and RMC.
For users that have a supported Mac,their choice won't make a difference,since no patches will be applied to their system.

Special thanks go to [**dosdude1**](https://www.dosdude1.com/) and [**RMC Team**](https://rmc-team.github.io).Without their contribution,this feature would not have been possible.

### Custom OS Images
With the release of version 1.2.0,BackToMac supports custom OS images.Users can now create USB sticks with their own image files.Currently,BackToMac supports only `.iso` and `.cdr` image files.(thanks to @Minh-Ton for the idea.)

> The program is pretty straight forward and easy to use.It only requires a few clicks to get the job done!
