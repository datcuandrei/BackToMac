# Features
### Graphical User Interface
BackToMac is the only application on Linux that was made specifically for creating bootable macOS USBs.And it also has a GUI.

### Patchers
BackToMac was created with both supported and unsupported Macs in mind.After going through the instructions,the user can choose between two patchers from two different developers : dosdude1 and RMC.
For users that have a supported Mac,their choice won't make a difference,since no patches will be applied to their system.

Special thanks go to [**dosdude1**](https://www.dosdude1.com/) and [**RMC Team**](https://rmc-team.github.io).Without their contribution,this feature would not have been possible.

### Original macOS Images
By default, BackToMac automatically uses images that are patched to work on both supported and unsupported Macs. If, however, the user wants to use an original, untouched image of macOS, they can be easily downloaded using the link below:

<b>macOS Catalina</b> : *through app store* <br>
<b>macOS Mojave</b> : *through app store* <br>
<b>macOS High Sierra</b> : *through app store* <br>
<b>macOS Sierra</b> : http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-39476-20191023-48f365f4-0015-4c41-9f44-39d3d2aca067/InstallOS.dmg <br>


Not included with BackToMac, but can be flashed with ease : <br>
<b>OS X El Capitan</b> : http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-41424-20191024-218af9ec-cf50-4516-9011-228c78eda3d2/InstallMacOSX.dmg <br>
<b>OS X Yosemite</b> : http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-41343-20191023-02465f92-3ab5-4c92-bfe2-b725447a070d/InstallMacOSX.dmg <br>

*taken from the [HT211683](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683) support page.*

These images can be flashed using the `Custom OS Images` option.

### Custom OS Images
With the release of version 1.2.0,BackToMac supports flashing custom OS images.Users can now create USB sticks with their own image files.(thanks to @Minh-Ton for the idea.).

The flashing process is based on `dd`, so all formats that `dd` supports will work with BackToMac.

> The program is pretty straight forward and easy to use.It only requires a few clicks to get the job done!

## Step by step instructions
For step-by-step instructions on how to successfully create a bootable USB,see [INSTRUCTIONS](https://github.com/datcuandrei/BackToMac/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Permission denied 
This error occures when the user does not have enough privileges to access the program.
In this case,we need to get ownership of the app by typing :
